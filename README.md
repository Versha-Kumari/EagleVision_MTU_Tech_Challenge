# EagleVision_MTU_Tech_Challenge
To avoid leakage in a jet engine during maintenance tests, our solution is EagleVision, an Image recognition tool. The tool uses a live camera at the working station of mechanic and is positioned such that to be installed tubes and installed O-rings are clearly visible. The live video feed is sent to the image recognition tool, which then performs 5 crucial features to classify faults. First it will identify if the seal has been installed onto the pipe. Secondly it will detect if this is damaged. Thirdly it will detect if the right specification of seal has been installed on to the pipe. Next it will recognize whether the seal is installed in the right groove position in the pipe and finally if the right seal tube combination is present. The mechanic does not need to operate any code, all has to do is install the Oring on to the pipe as he has already being doing previously. Even if there is an unexpected outcome in the 5 analysed features, an error message will automatically be output which alerts the mechanic of a potential fault being present.
